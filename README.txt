I wrote MASCOTpyLaTeX in order to extract useful 
information from a mascot search result (.dat) 
file, and print it out in a .tex file to be 
compiled into a pretty LaTeX pdf. :)

I am using msparser distribution version 2.5.0
for Python 2.7. msparser is provided by 
Matrix Science, and they own the copyright to it 
etc. I think.
